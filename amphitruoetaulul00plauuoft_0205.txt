NOTES. 193

117. 6. Temeti nihil. We learn from Servius
in his comment upon a passage of virgil, that
though it was lawful to make use of wine in sacri-
ficing to Ceres, it was not allowed at nuptials cele-
brated in honor of that goddess,

— 10. Impurate, quanquam Vulcano studes ,⁶
“ You who are unpurified, though your business is
so much with fi1·e.’' The allusion is to metals which
are purged from their dross by fire.

118. 3. In puteo ‚- ⁴⁶ under ground‚'’ i. e. in a
place where slaves were confined by way of pun-
ishment.

— 5. Si . . . inseri5 “ but if they should eat as
fast as they cook, our guests above stairs would go
without supper whilst the cooks below were eating
theirs.''

—— 8. Rapacidarum. This word seems to have
been made by Plautus for the occasion. He forms
it from rapax, as AEacidae from AEacus, Scipiadae
from Scipio, διο.

119. 8. Adii manum,- “I choused‚” or “disap-
pointed.” Some translate it, ‘⁶ Ι bid adieu.”

-- 13. Accessit . . . sententiam3 “my mind came
to this conclusion.’'

— 20. Aulam. Festus says that the ancients
used aula sor olla because they would not double a
letter.

—- 22. Aula quaerz'tur. At the sound of aula,
for which Congrio calls, Euclio's thoughts are irn-

mediately fixed on his aula, his aulularia, which
contained his treasure.
