180 No'rEs,

69. 13. Dum id modo fiat bono ,· “ so that nothing
be done contrary to the laws.”

— 16. Coronam. It was customary among the
ancients to wear ohaplets at their carousals.

-—- 18. Madidus sobrius ‚- “ drenched though not
drunk.'’

— 24. Ornatum. The chaplet just spoken of.

70. l. Naucratem. The accusative for the no-

⁴

minative, in imitation of the Greeks. So in Virgil z
Urbem quam statuo restra est.

In this scene the poet shows much skill in making
Amphitryon tell so particularly the several places
he had been at to look for Naucrates3 for if it had
been otherwise, the spectators might have won-
dered that Sosia did not meet him, since he was
gone but a little before to the same place, and then
meeting would have spoiled the whole plot.

-— 10. EugepOE. An interjectiou of joy or
approved, here used ironically.

71. 9. Ulmorum acheruns5 “consumer of elm
rods :” i. e. whose back receives as many olm rods
as Acheron does souls. So in the Capteivi os
Plautus:

Voe illis virgis miseris, quse hodie in tergojmorientur meo!

Acheron, (from α privative, and χαίρω to rejoice,)
was the abode of the dead. See Virgil’s fine de-
scription of it, AE. vi. 295.
