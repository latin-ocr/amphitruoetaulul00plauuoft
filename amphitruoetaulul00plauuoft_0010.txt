6 PREFACE.

The text adopted in this edition is that
of GronoviuS, which· is generally admitted
to be the best. The notes have been
prepared, as in the preceding volumes of
the series, to throw light upon sueh pas-
sages in the text as require illustration.
In many instanees they are merely trans-
lations from various Latin commentaries
upon the writings of Plautus, which have
been published in Europe.

The editor again expresses his sense of
the favor bestowed by the public on the
results of his former lab01·S‚and respect-

sully solicits a continuance of it.
