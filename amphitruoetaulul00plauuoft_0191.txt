NoTEs. 179

Aster public sacrifices followed a feast which was
sumptuonsly prepared by the Septemviri epulones.
In private sacrifices, the persons who offered them
feasted with their friends on the parts of the victims
which fell to them.

Sacra tulere suam [ partem] .· pars est data cetera mensis.
Ovid, M. xii. 154.

— 16. Quantum potest: se. fieri.

sert, Quando isthaec omnia eajztrdsli te mihi dixe per
jocum.

68. 1. In this scene, which seems to be a con-
tinuation of the prologne‚ Mcrcury addresses him-
sels to the spectator-s as he did in Act I, Sc. 2.

- 3. &Vara comoediis: “Why may not I, who
am a deity, have the sanie license as a slave in
comedies, with threats to bid the people clear the
way.” This passage seems to be intended by
Plautus as a satire upon the dramatists of his time,
who considered it a great beanty to introduce a
slave running in great haste to tell some such news
as before mentioned, and throwing down all whom
he meetS, extorting thus a laugh from the spectators
when they could not do so by better means. It is
somewhat remarkable that our author commits the
same fault he attempts to ridicule, in no less than
three of his eomedies.
