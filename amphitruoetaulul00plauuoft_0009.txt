PREFACE.

A SELEcrloN from the best Latin
Classics would be singularly incomplete
if it did not contain some portion of the
writings of Plautus. The comedies of
this author abound in striking precepts
of morality‚ in exemplifications of national
manners and customS, and in allusione to
every circumstance of lise. A great vari-
ety is obser-ved in his plots‚ and the rich
vein of humor Which distinguishes them
has been imitated, but not exceeded, by
subsequent dramatis: compositione. The
wit and diction are clearly Romans and
peculiar to the author; both have been

admired by a Cicero and a Caesar.
